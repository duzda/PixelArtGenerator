Transparency = chance to be drawn  
Any pixel with 0.5 alpha will have 50 % chance to be drawn, 0.2 alpha equals 20 % and so on.  
Multiple layers are supported via specifying layer width and supplying an image where all layers are saved nexto to each other as a horizontal image.  
It's also possible to outline the resulting image, remove stray pixels, add mirroring.  
Color mapping is also included, where the mapped color is either color or array of colors.
